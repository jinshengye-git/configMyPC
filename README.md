# Mac Pro 2010 config

**I delete the OS X High Sierra by mistake, therefore I cannot rebstore the OS**

## Before-install

0. Display must connect on the None-Nvidia Graphic Card.
1. prepare the Ubuntu 18.04 install USB stick.
2. pull out the hard disk No. 1  so that the OS will load the USB stick to install the OS.
3. prepare USB-Disk driver,  insert the OS X cd.
4. insert the USB stick

## Install the Ubuntu OS

I chose the Mint 19, based on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS

after install the os, you can install Nvidia driver to enable the GPU.
remember to connect Display cable on the Nvidia GPU after install the driver.
